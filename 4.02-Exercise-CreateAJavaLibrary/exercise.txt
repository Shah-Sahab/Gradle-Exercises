Time for you to modularize your joke telling app. You'll create a joke telling
app, and not one, but two Java libraries!

1. Create a new project in Android Studio, using all the defaults. - Done

2. Manually add a Java module with a class called JokeSmith with a getJoke()
method. Feel free to supply a funny joke, or just a debug method, if
you're no fun. Remember to set sourceCompatibility = 1.7, so your library is
usable on Android. This line should be added to the build.gradle file of the
module. - Done

3. Add your new module to your settings.gradle file - Done

4. Declare a project dependency between your app and JokeSmith - Done

5. Add a text view to MainActivityFragment and populate it with a joke from
JokeSmith. - Done

6. Use the Android Studio wizard to add a second Java library called
JokeWizard. To access the wizard, navigate to:

    File > New > New Module > Java Library

Note that the wizard adds JokeWizard to your settings.gradle - Done

7. Declare a project dependency between JokeWizard and JokeSmith - Done

8. Implement a getJoke() method on JokeWizard that uses the getJoke() method
on JokeSmith. - Done

9. Add a project dependence between your app and JokeWizard - Done

9. Add another text view to MainActivityFragment and populate it with a joke
from JokeWizard. - Done


Complaints about this project:

Quiz 7 : 
"8. Implement a getJoke() method on JokeWizard that uses the getJoke() method
on JokeSmith." - Please do a better job at explaining what it means? on JokeWizard that used the getJoke() method on JokeSmith? What does that mean?

The confusion is because of instruction # 7 i.e. 7. Declare a project dependency between JokeWizard and JokeSmith. Basically it should have said, Declare a dependency of JokeSmith Project in JokeWizard Project. Be more Specific, dont try to be dramatic!
